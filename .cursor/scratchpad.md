## Lessons
- Always check current file structure before making changes
- Update all related files when changing project name
- Font changes require updates in multiple places
- When removing pages, also update navigation and routing logic
- Fixed navigation requires layout adjustments (padding-top)
- Roboto Condensed only supports weights 300, 400, and 700 - not 500
- Always verify font weight availability before using in Next.js font configuration
- Motion/react provides excellent animation capabilities for UI components
- Component integration requires proper dependency management
- Integrating components directly can simplify architecture and improve performance
- Sometimes a clean slate approach is the best way to move forward
