# BatesMote Project Changes

## Background and Motivation
The user wants to implement the following changes to the UI:

1. **Entrance Page**: Update the entrance page to use the new `1stLobby.png` image as background instead of the current entrance image
2. **Lobby (Floor 0)**: Update the lobby background to use the `1stLobby.png` image 
3. **Game Room**: Create a new page that uses `GameRoom.png` as background, accessed via the right clickable area in the lobby
4. **Faucet Image**: Replace the current UFO pixel art in the faucet page with the actual `image.png` file in the left square

3. **Maintaining Functionality**: Ensuring existing features (wallet connection, faucet claims, clickable areas) continue working
4. **Route Management**: Adding new game room route and updating navigation logic
5. **Image Replacement**: Carefully replacing the UFO pixel art while maintaining layout and functionality

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
**Executor Mode**: Mobile background images implementation completed successfully!

Final State:
- âœ… Entrance page updated with `1stLobby.png` background and `Entrancemob.png` for mobile

## Current Focus: Staking Functionality Implementation

### âœ… Analysis Complete:
- Both staking and LP staking pages currently display farms but lack transaction functionality
- Pages use smartContractService to fetch farm data from farms.abi.json contract
- Need to implement stake, unstake, and harvest transactions with proper user balance checks

### ðŸ”§ Implementation Plan:
1. Create staking transaction service using farms.abi.json
2. Add user balance fetching for staking tokens
3. Implement mini popup modals for stake/unstake inputs
4. Add proper validation and transaction handling
5. Update both staking and LP staking pages with new functionality

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
**Executor**: Staking functionality implementation completed!

### âœ… Implementation Complete:

1. **Enhanced Smart Contract Service**: Added transaction creation methods for stake, unstake, and harvest operations using the farms.abi.json contract
2. **Staking Modal Component**: Created reusable modal for stake/unstake with user balance validation and input handling
3. **Updated Staking Rooms Page**: Added full staking functionality with proper error handling and transaction flow
4. **Updated LP Staking Page**: Added identical functionality for LP token staking
5. **User Balance Integration**: Implemented balance checking and validation before transactions

### ðŸ”§ Technical Features:
- **Stake**: Opens modal showing user's token balance, validates input, creates ESDT transfer transaction
- **Unstake**: Only enabled if user has staked tokens, shows staked balance, validates unstake amount
- **Harvest**: Checks harvestable rewards > 0 before allowing harvest, direct transaction execution
- **Real-time Updates**: All pages refresh data after successful transactions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and validation
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during transaction processing
- **Responsive Design**: Modal works on all screen sizes with pixelated styling

### ðŸ§ª Ready for Testing:
Both staking and LP staking pages now have fully functional:
- âœ… Stake buttons with balance validation
- âœ… Unstake buttons with staked balance validation  
- âœ… Harvest buttons with harvestable rewards validation
- âœ… Transaction creation using farms.abi.json contract
- âœ… Toast notifications for success/error states
- âœ… Data refresh after successful transactions

**The staking functionality is now fully implemented and ready for user testing!**

### ðŸ”— **Connect Wallet Integration Added:**

Added direct wallet connection functionality to both staking pages:

- **Connect Wallet Buttons**: Added prominent "CONNECT WALLET" buttons to both staking and LP staking pages
- **Direct Connection**: Uses `UnlockPanelManager` for seamless in-page wallet connection (no redirect required)
- **Auto-refresh**: Pages automatically refresh data when user connects their wallet
- **Consistent UI**: Buttons match the existing design with purple/pink gradient and pixelated styling
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover and tap animations for better UX

Now users can connect their wallets directly from the staking pages without having to navigate back to the main page!

### ðŸ”§ **Balance Fetching Fix:**

Fixed the staking modal to show real user balances instead of hardcoded values:

- **Real Balance Fetching**: Modal now fetches actual token balances from MultiversX API
- **Loading States**: Shows "Loading..." while fetching balance data
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles tokens not found or API errors
- **UI Improvements**: Disabled buttons and inputs while loading
- **Accurate Validation**: MAX button and balance validation now use real balances

The stake popup now correctly displays your actual token balance instead of showing "1" for everyone!

## Lessons
- Always check current file structure before making changes
- Update all related files when changing project name
- Font changes require updates in multiple places
- When removing pages, also update navigation and routing logic
- Fixed navigation requires layout adjustments (padding-top)
- Roboto Condensed only supports weights 300, 400, and 700 - not 500
- Always verify font weight availability before using in Next.js font configuration
- Motion/react provides excellent animation capabilities for UI components
- Component integration requires proper dependency management
- Integrating components directly can simplify architecture and improve performance
- Sometimes a clean slate approach is the best way to move forward
